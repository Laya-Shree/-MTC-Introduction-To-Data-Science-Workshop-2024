## 🐍 **2. Python and Its Role in Data Science**

Python is the leading programming language in data science due to its simplicity, vast libraries, and versatility.

### Popular Python Libraries:

| Library | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| 📐**Numpy** | Numerical computations |
| 🧮**Pandas** | Data manipulation and analysis |
| 📈**Matplotlib** | Data visualization |
| 📊**Seaborn** | Statistical data visualization |

```python
# Installing Libraries
pip install pandas
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn
```

```python
# Importing Libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

## 📐**3. Numpy**

`Numpy` is the foundation for numerical operations in Python.

### Key Concepts:

- **Numpy Arrays**: Efficient arrays for storing numerical data.
- **Operations**: Mathematical operations like sum, mean, reshape, and indexing.



## 🧮**4. Pandas**

`Pandas` is the go-to library for data manipulation and analysis. It introduces powerful data structures like **DataFrames**.

### Key Concepts:

- **DataFrames**: 2D labeled data structures (similar to Excel tables).
- **Data Manipulation**: Filtering, sorting, aggregating, and handling missing values.



##  **5. Matplotlib and Seaborn**

`Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` are essential for creating insightful data visualizations.

### **Matplotlib**: General-purpose plotting library



### **Seaborn**: High-level interface for attractive visualizations

## 📚 **Cheat Sheet and Glossary**

Here are some key terms and commands you'll use throughout your data science journey.

### 📝 **Cheat Sheet:**

---

## 🔑 **Glossary of Terms**

- **Array**: A data structure that holds a fixed number of elements of a single type.
- **DataFrame**: A 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.
- **Visualization**: The representation of data in a graphical format.
- **Aggregation**: A computation that summarizes groups of data (e.g., sum, average).
- **Missing Data**: Occurs when no data value is stored for a variable in a dataset.

---

## 🎉 **Hands-on Practice**

Try the following tasks:

1. Load a dataset into Pandas.
2. Visualize the data using Matplotlib or Seaborn.
3. Apply basic data manipulations using Pandas (`filter`, `groupby`, `aggregate`).
