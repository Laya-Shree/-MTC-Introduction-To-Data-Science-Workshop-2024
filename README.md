## 🔑 **Glossary of Terms**

1. **Array**: A data structure that stores elements of the same type in a fixed size.  
2. **DataFrame**: A 2D labeled data structure with rows and columns, used for data manipulation in pandas.  
3. **Data Cleaning**: The process of correcting or removing inaccurate data points to ensure data quality.  
4. **Missing Data**: Absence of a data value for a variable in a dataset, handled through deletion or imputation.  
5. **Data Preprocessing**: Transforming raw data into a clean and usable format for analysis or modeling.  
6. **Features**: The measurable properties or characteristics of data used as input in machine learning models.  
7. **Feature Selection**: The process of selecting the most important variables to use in model building.  
8. **Feature Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into numerical form for machine learning models.  
9. **One-Hot Encoding**: A method to convert categorical variables into binary vectors for each unique category.  
10. **Label Encoding**: Assigning numerical values to categorical labels in a dataset.  
11. **Normalization**: Scaling data to ensure consistency across the feature's range of values.  
12. **StandardScaler**: A tool to standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.  
13. **Outliers**: Data points that deviate significantly from other observations in the dataset.  
14. **Exploratory Analysis**: Analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visualizations.  
15. **Target**: The variable or outcome that a model aims to predict, also called the dependent variable.
